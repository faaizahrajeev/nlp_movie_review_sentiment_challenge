# Movie Review Sentiment Challenge - NLP 2024

Challenge Details:

Develop a text classification system to categorize movie reviews as positive or negative. 

## Instructions:
• Employ regular expressions to clean the text data and perform text normalization techniques
<br>• Construct N-grams from the text data. Discuss the choice of N-grams for feature extraction.
<br>• Implement a Naive Bayes classifier to categorize the reviews. Optimize the classifier for better performance in sentiment analysis.
<br>• Evaluate the classifier using metrics such as precision, recall, and F-measure. Perform cross-validation to assess the model’s robustness.
<br>• Represent text data using Vector Semantics or word embeddings. Use cosine similarity to compare vectors and refine feature representation.
<br>• Integrate neural networks or pretrained word embeddings into the model to enhance classification performance.

<br>Programming Language: Python
<br>• Libraries: NLTK, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch (for neural networks), gensim (for word embeddings)
<br>• Environment: Jupyter Notebooks

<br>Sample Data for Training
<br>Review | Sentiment
<br>The movie was fantastic, I loved every minute of it! | Positive
<br>Terrible acting and a predictable plot, definitely not worth the watch. | Negative
